# Vim Configuration

This repo stores the Vim configuration on my Linux machines.  
To setup the configuration on a new machine, do the following:

1. Clone the repo to your `~/.vim/` directory.
2. Create your `~/.vimrc` file with the following command:  

        echo "runtime vimrc" > ~/.vimrc  

   which will load the configuration in `~/.vim/vimrc` at runtime.
